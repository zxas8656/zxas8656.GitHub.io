Jiaozi(Chinese:&#39290;&#23376;) are a kind of Chinese dumpling, commonly eaten across East Asia. It's one of the major foods eaten during the Chinese New Year and year round in the northern provinces. Though considered part of Chinese cuisine, jiaozi are popular and often eaten in other parts of Asia and in Western countries.

Jiaozi typically consist of a ground meat and/or vegetable filling wrapped into a thinly rolled piece of dough, which is then sealed by pressing the edges together or by crimping.

			<div  class="col span_7_of_8">

<p>
In China, there are several different folk stories explaining the origin of Jiaozi and its name.</p>

<p>Traditionally, Jiaozi were thought to be invented by Zhang Zhongjing during the Eastern Han, who was one of the greatest practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine in history. Jiaozi was originally referred to as "tender ears" (Chinese:&#23047;&#32819;; pinyin: jiao'er) because it's used to treat frostbitten ears .It was during a winner, when Zhang Zhongjing was on his way home, he found many common people had frostbitten ears, because they didn't have warm clothes and enough food. He wanted to treat those poor people. So Zhang stewed lamb, peppers, and some warming medicines in a big pot, fished those food, and chopped them. After that, he put chopped food in many small dough. He named those "Jiao'er " because he was meant to treat people's frostbitten ears. He boiled them and handed them out with the soup to poor people. He had done handing out for a long time, until the coming of Chinese traditional new year. In order to celebrate new year as well as recovering from frostbitten ears, people imitated Zhang's making" Jiao'er ". Today people don't need " Jiao'er " to treat ears, but they always remember Zhang's kindness.</p>

<p>There are various other theories. It has been suggested that jiaozi may have derived from dumplings in Western Asia, however, sources indicate that similar dumplings were already sold and eaten during and before the Song dynasty. In Western Han dynasty(b.c202-8) (Before Eastern Han) " jiaozi "(&#39290;&#23376;) is called "Jiaozi " (&#35282;&#23376;). In the Three Kingdoms period(220-280), the book Guang Ya (&#24191;&#38597;) wrote by Zhang Yi( &#24352;&#25558;), made a record about the jiaozi. Yan Zitui (&#39068;&#23376;&#25512;) from Northern Qi in Northern dynasty(550-577) also wrote book saying: "Today the jiaozi, shaped like a crescent moon, is a common food in the world." Six Dynasties Turfan tombs contained dumplings.Later in Tang Dynasty, jiaozi becomes more popular, called "Bian Shi"( &#25153;&#39135;). Chinese archaeologists have found a bowl of jiaozi in the Tang Dynasty tombs in Turpan.7th or 8th century old dumplings and wontons were found in Turfan.</p>

<p>It's also said that Jiaozi were so named because they were horn shaped. The Chinese word for "horn" is jiao (Chinese: &#35282;), and jiaozi was originally written with the Chinese character for "horn", but later it was replaced by a specific character &#39171;, which has the food radical on the left and the phonetic component (&#20132;) on the right.</p>

<p>At the same time, Jiaozi looks like the golden ingots yuan bao used during the Ming Dynasty for money and the name sounds like the word for the earliest paper money, so serving them is believed to bring prosperity. Many families eat these at midnight on Chinese New Year's Eve. Some cooks will even hide a clean coin for the lucky to find.</p>

<p>Nowadays, Jiaozi are eaten all year round, and can be eaten at any time of the day -breakfast, lunch or dinner. They can constitute one course, starter or side dish, or the main meal. In China, sometimes Jiaozi is served as a last course during restaurant meals. As a breakfast dish, Jiaozi are prepared alongside Xiaolongbao at inexpensive, roadside restaurants. Typically, they are served in small steamers containing ten pieces each. Although mainly consumed at breakfast, these small restaurants keep them hot on steamers, and ready to eat all day. Jiaozi is always served with a soy sauce-based dipping sauce that may include vinegar, garlic, ginger, rice wine, hot sauce, and sesame oil.
