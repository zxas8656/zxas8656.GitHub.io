        <p>    Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to Asia. After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world. There are many different types of tea; some teas, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or grassy notes.</P>     
        <p>
        Tea originated in southwestern China, where it was used as a medicinal drink. It was popularized as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to the West during the 16th century. During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among Britons, who started large-scale production and commercialization of the plant in India to bypass a Chinese monopoly at that time.</p>
        <p>
        The phrase herbal tea usually refers to infusions of fruit or herbs made without the tea plant, such as steeps of rosehip, chamomile, or rooibos. These are also known as tisanes or herbal infusions to distinguish them from "tea" as it is commonly construed.</p>

<summary>Serving</summary>
<p>To preserve the pretannin tea without requiring it all to be poured into cups, a second teapot may be used. The steeping pot is best unglazed earthenware; Yixing pots are the best known of these, famed for the high-quality clay from which they are made. The serving pot is generally porcelain, which retains the heat better. Larger teapots are a post-19th century invention, as tea before this time was very rare and very expensive. Experienced tea-drinkers often insist the tea should not be stirred around while it is steeping (sometimes called winding or mashing in the UK). This, they say, will do little to strengthen the tea, but is likely to bring the tannins out in the same way that brewing too long will do. For the same reason, one should not squeeze the last drops out of a teabag; if stronger tea is desired, more tea leaves should be used.</P>

<summary>Additives</summary>
<p>
The addition of milk to tea in Europe was first mentioned in 1680 by the epistolist Madame de S¨¦vign¨¦. Many teas are traditionally drunk with milk in cultures where dairy products are consumed. These include Indian masala chai and British tea blends. These teas tend to be very hearty varieties of black tea which can be tasted through the milk, such as Assams, or the East Friesian blend. Milk is thought to neutralise remaining tannins and reduce acidity.The Han Chinese do not usually drink milk with tea but the Manchus do, and the elite of the Qing Dynasty of the Chinese Empire continued to do so. Hong Kong-style milk tea is based on British colonial habits. Tibetans and other Himalayan peoples traditionally drink tea with milk or yak butter and salt. In Eastern European countries (Russia, Poland and Hungary) and in Italy, tea is commonly served with lemon juice. In Poland, tea with milk is called a bawarka ("Bavarian style"), and is often drunk by pregnant and nursing women. In Australia, tea with milk is white tea.</p>
<p>
The order of steps in preparing a cup of tea is a much-debated topic, and can vary widely between cultures or even individuals. Some say it is preferable to add the milk before the tea, as the high temperature of freshly brewed tea can denature the proteins found in fresh milk, similar to the change in taste of UHT milk, resulting in an inferior-tasting beverage. Others insist it is better to add the milk after brewing the tea, as black tea is often brewed as close to boiling as possible. The addition of milk chills the beverage during the crucial brewing phase, if brewing in a cup rather than using a pot, meaning the delicate flavour of a good tea cannot be fully appreciated. By adding the milk afterwards, it is easier to dissolve sugar in the tea and also to ensure the desired amount of milk is added, as the colour of the tea can be observed.[citation needed] Historically, the order of steps was taken as an indication of class: only those wealthy enough to afford good-quality porcelain would be confident of its being able to cope with being exposed to boiling water unadulterated with milk. Higher temperature difference means faster heat transfer so the earlier you add milk the slower the drink cools. A 2007 study published in the European Heart Journal found certain beneficial effects of tea may be lost through the addition of milk.</p>
<P> 
 Many flavourings are added to varieties of tea during processing. Among the best known are Chinese jasmine tea, with jasmine oil or flowers, the spices in Indian masala chai, and Earl Grey tea, which contains oil of bergamot. A great range of modern flavours have been added to these traditional ones. In eastern India, people also drink lemon tea or lemon masala tea. Lemon tea simply contains hot tea with lemon juice and sugar. Masala lemon tea contains hot tea with roasted cumin seed powder, lemon juice, black salt and sugar, which gives it a tangy, spicy taste. Adding a piece of ginger when brewing tea is a popular habit of Sri Lankans, who also use other types of spices such as cinnamon to sweeten the aroma.</p>
<p>
Other popular additives to tea by the tea-brewer or drinker include sugar, liquid honey or a solid Honey Drop, agave nectar, fruit jams, and mint. In China, sweetening tea was traditionally regarded as a feminine practice. In colder regions, such as Mongolia, Tibet and Nepal, butter is added to provide necessary calories. Tibetan butter tea contains rock salt and dre, a butter made from yak milk, which is churned vigorously in a cylindrical vessel closely resembling a butter churn. The same may be said for salt tea, which is popular in the Hindu Kush region of northern Pakistan.</p>
<P>
Alcohol, such as whisky or brandy, may also be added to tea.</p>
<p>
The flavour of the tea can also be altered by pouring it from different heights, resulting in varying degrees of aeration. The art of high-altitude pouring is used principally by people in Northern Africa (e.g. Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, Libya and Western Sahara), but also in West Africa (e.g. Guinea, Mali, Senegal) and can positively alter the flavour of the tea, but it is more likely a technique to cool the beverage destined to be consumed immediately. In certain cultures, the tea is given different names depending on the height from which it is poured. In Mali, gunpowder tea is served in series of three, starting with the highest oxidisation or strongest, unsweetened tea (cooked from fresh leaves), locally referred to as "strong like death", followed by a second serving, where the same tea leaves are boiled again with some sugar added ("pleasant as life"), and a third one, where the same tea leaves are boiled for the third time with yet more sugar added ("sweet as love"). Green tea is the central ingredient of a distinctly Malian custom, the "Grin", an informal social gathering that cuts across social and economic lines, starting in front of family compound gates in the afternoons and extending late into the night, and is widely popular in Bamako and other large urban areas.</p>
<p>
In Southeast Asia, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, the practice of pouring tea from a height has been refined further using black tea to which condensed milk is added, poured from a height from one cup to another several times in alternating fashion and in quick succession, to create a tea with entrapped air bubbles creating a frothy "head" in the cup. This beverage, teh tarik, literally, "pulled tea" (which has its origin as a hot Indian tea beverage), has a creamier taste than flat milk tea and is extremely popular in the region. Tea pouring in Malaysia has been further developed into an art form in which a dance is done by people pouring tea from one container to another, which in any case takes skill and precision. The participants, each holding two containers, one full of tea, pour it from one to another. They stand in lines and squares and pour the tea into each other's pots. The dance must be choreographed to allow anyone who has both pots full to empty them and refill those of whoever has no tea at any one point.</p>

<h4>1.Simple Iced Tea</h4>
<details>
<summary>Here is steps</summary>
<ol>
     <li>Bring 2 cups (480 ml) of water to a rapid boil. You can boil the water in a small pan or a pot.</li>  
     <li>Turn off the heat.</li>
     <li>Add 3-5 bags of your favorite black tea. Ceylon and Keemun teas can work best because they won't turn cloudy when they're left to stand. You can even choose a special tea blend that is made specifically for iced tea.</li>
     <li>Leave the teabags in the hot water for 5 minutes. Any longer than that and the tea will be too bitter. If you leave them in for less time than that, then the tea will be too weak. This will be a very strong mixture of tea -- you'll dilute it with water momentarily. Remove the tea bags after the time has passed.</li>
     <li>Pour the tea into a pitcher. Wait 5-10 minutes for it to cool down.</li>
     <li>Pour 2 cups (480 ml) of cold water into the tea. This will dilute the tea and will make the mixture less strong. You can stir the mixture for best results.</li>
     <li>Refrigerate the mixture until it's chilled. This should take 2-3 hours.</li>
     <li> Serve the tea. Pour the tea into a tall glass that is filled with ice. Squeeze a slice of lemon into the tea and add a sprig of mint to the top. If you'd like to add sugar, start by stirring in half a teaspoon and add more to taste.</li>
</ol>
</details>

<h4>2.Fruity Iced Tea</h4>
<details>
<summary>Here is steps</summary>
<ol>
     <li>Make strong black tea. Use the same method you would use to make simple iced tea: just boil 2 cups of water, steep 3-5 tea bags in it for 5 minutes, pour 2 cups of water into the mix, and add sugar or lemon to taste. Pour this mixture into a pitcher.</li>  
     <li>Refrigerate to chill. Leave the tea in the fridge for 2-3 hours.</li>
     <li>Add 1/2 cup of sugar syrup. Stir this into the mixture -- if it's not sweet enough, add more of the syrup.</li>
     <li>Fill 1 cup with slivers of fresh fruit. Dice peaches, pineapples, strawberries, raspberries, and apples until they fit into 1 cup. You can sprinkle them with a bit of lemon juice.</li>
     <li>Add the cup to the tea mixture. Stir it around until the fruit mixes in with the black tea and floats evenly in the pitcher.</li>
     <li>Serve the tea. Pour the tea into a glass filled with ice. Add a sprig of mint to the top.</li>
     </ol>
</details>


<h4>3.Strawberry Iced Tea</h4>
<details>
<summary>Here is steps</summary>
<ol>
     <li>Pour 2 quarts/1.8 liters (0.5 US gal) of hot black tea tea into a ceramic or glass mixing bowl.</li>  
     <li>Add the 1/3 cups of superfine (caster) sugar to the tea. Stir thoroughly to dissolve the sugar.</li> 
     <li>Add 1/2 cups of freshly squeezed lemon juice. Test to see if it requires additional sweetening or lemon juice and adjust accordingly. Then, set it aside to cool.</li> 
     <li>Puree 31 oz/900g strawberries. Push the puree through a fine-sieve to remove the pips. Press on the mixture with the back of a wooden spoon.</li> 
     <li>Once the tea has cooled, add the puree and mix. Mix thoroughly. Pour the mixture into a pitcher.</li> 
     <li>Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Let this mixture cool off and settle together for thirty minutes or longer.</li> 
     <li>Serve. Fill a glass with ice and pour the tea into it. Add a few strawberries -- whole or sliced -- to the side of the glass as a garnish.</li> 
     </ol>
</details>

<h4>4.Vanilla Iced Green Tea</h4>
<details>
<summary>Here is steps</summary>
<ol>
     <li>Brew 4 rounded teaspoons of Sencha tea in 1 liter/33 fl oz of hot water. Let the tea infuse for 1-2 minutes.</li>  
     <li>Strain the tea into a jug or pitcher.</li> 
     <li>Add 1 tablespoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice. Stir well.</li> 
     <li>Add 1 tablespoon of honey. Stir well.</li> 
     <li>Stir the ingredients together. Stir the tea until it's evenly blended.</li> 
     <li>Serve the tea with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Add one scoop of vanilla ice cream to each glass and finish by pouring the chilled green tea over the top. This tea can be served as a dessert.</li> 
     </ol>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tips</summary>
<ol>
     <li>Is it over 90F outside? Get a large jar with a lid. Fill with water and teabags. Seal jar with lid and place in the sun. Leave outside for 3 hours or more. Serve over ice.</li>  
     <li>The rule of thumb for making iced tea is to add 50 percent more tea than you would for a hot tea; this provides enough flavor that won't be diluted by the melting ice.</li> 
     <li>For colder, faster iced tea, you can put the tea in the freezer for an hour or two.</li> 
     <li>Never brew tea in a coffee maker like most restaurants. The taste is unmistakable. Homemade tea is always better!</li> 
     <li>As an alternative to lemon, try adding a few lemon myrtle leaves.</li> 
     <li>You can also add a squeeze of lemon to make it lemon iced tea.</li> 
     <li>You might want to add a few mint leaves semi-crushed to your tea as it cools, to give it a light and minty flavor.</li>
     <li>Did you know? Tea can be affected by the same fungal reaction that can occur in corked wine? If your tea smells or tastes musty or moldy, it's tainted––throw it away.</li>  
     <li>To sweeten tea after it is cold, use agave nectar. The agave dissolves in cold liquid, unlike sugar or honey.</li> 
     <li>You can also make tea with ginger for extra taste.</li> 
     <li>Make sure not to put too much sugar in anything or it will taste bad. Never put too much of anything. Remember: Less is more.</li> 
     <li>Don't go over the 5 minute limit with the teabags in the hot water.</li> 
     <li>Due to tea solids, iced tea made in this way sometimes becomes cloudy; if this happens, it doesn't affect the taste. However, if you don't like how it looks, pour a small amount of boiling water into the tea; this will clear it up.</li>
